Freetrade is a investment platform aiming to make investing open to all.

I am part of the Discovery and Insights team. We're responsible for making sure users can find investments they're looking for and understanding their portfolio. 

Whilst being there, I've been a part of releasing many features including fractional trading, stronger insights, and self-invested personal pensions. I'm focusing on making the apps better for our users, including [dark mode](https://twitter.com/freetrade/status/1227537684450758657), [a brand-new iPad UI](https://freetrade.io/blog/introducing-freetrade-for-ipad) and [performance improvements](https://amlcurran.co.uk/articles/profiling-at-freetrade).
