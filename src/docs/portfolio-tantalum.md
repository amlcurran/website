Harman Spark is a connected car app developed in collaboration with Harman and Tantalum Corporation.

My work on this project included ensuring work was properly planned and that the developers had enough say and influence in what they were working on. I also was responsible for the sub-project of making the app compatible for white-labelling for other clients.
