Backen.de was produced in collaboration with Oetker Digital, of the Dr. Oetker brand.

We delivered a high quality MVP in 4,5 months across two platforms, with absolute consistency. 

My proudest moment of this project was starting with 3 Android engineers and three iOS engineers, and ending the project with 6 multiplatform engineers. Work on features was done pairing an Android developer with an iOS one, who would then implement the feature across both platforms one after another.
