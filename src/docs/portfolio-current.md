My current project is a small but vibrant app for a new client.

We are working on a product that interfaces with a Bluetooth device and a web backend, to give the user information about usage patterns.

Whilst small, this project has required my strong technical knowledge and project planning to ensure that the three teams (app, backend, and firmware) work in harmony to deliver the end product on time.
