This website is of course one of my side projects as well. It's built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), React, with Typescript.

The code is open source and you can find it on [Github](https://github.com/amlcurran/website). My main aim here was to learn more about different technologies outside of the mobile space and improve my web development skills.
