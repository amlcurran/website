Aid is a charity giving app I developed during a one-month sabbatical at the start of 2018. 

Giving to a single charity is easy, but giving to multiple is hard. 

Aid is meant to be a simple charity app, where you can view charities, their sectors, their websites, and, with three clicks, donate to certain charities.

I built this using Kotlin for Android and Objective-C for iOS.
