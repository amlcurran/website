I extensively use Pocket to save interesting recipes and articles.

However, Pocket makes it hard to triage and manage an extensive list, so I build this app to help. 

I used it as a learning exercise to understand Kotlin Multiplatform, building a React, iOS, and Android app from the same core business logic.

It also uses the newest technologies, such as Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI.
