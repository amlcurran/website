Modern life has so many distractions and little things that are easy to forget or even easier to continuely put off. 

Some friends and I try to hold each other accountable for these little things, such as posting cards, cleaning the oven, or sorting our finances. We initially started by placing events in each other's calendars, and figured this would be a great app.

It's currently only a small prototype, written in Flutter. I decided to use Flutter to whip up a quick prototype whilst user tests and the larger project are spun up. I'm working on this with [Leonie Brewin](https://www.leoniebrewin.com).
