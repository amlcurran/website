If you’re a small business or charity in Highbury, Stoke Newington, Walthamstow, or Horsham and would like some pro bono help with a website, app, or would like a chat about how to use technology, get in touch.

I'm looking to help local small businesses and charities improve their tech, whether it means improving an existing app or website, or talking through some ideas you’d like to bring.
