I wanted to build an app to track the books I read over the year.

I built this using Firebase as a backend, in order to learn about the technologies at use at [Freetrade](freetrade.io), as well as learning a bit about how to use ARKit on iOS.

I also upgraded this to use Mac Catalyst, so that I could build a Mac app using the same code, which I [wrote about](https://amlcurran.co.uk/articles/getting-started-mac-catalyst).
