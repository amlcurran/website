Built as a project intended to investigate cross-complication using j2objc, What's On is a simplified calendar app intended to show at-a-glance your agenda for the next two weeks.

I built this app in order to make it easier to keep a track of what I have on each evening, to avoid double-booking and give myself time at home.
