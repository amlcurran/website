Who you bank with matters.

At Kroo, I am responsible for the Mobile Platform function. Having recently formed brand-new platform teams, I joined Kroo to head up the mobile side of the platform. 

This role plays to my love of improving the developer experience in mobile, whilst presenting a new challenge to me in being my first role leading React Native development.

Since I joined, we've launched a full app redesign with no interruption of functionality, of which I'm incredibly proud. We've also improved performance, made the app feel more native, and increased the speed at which the product teams can deliver their features in the app.
