Join fitness star Joe Wicks in The Body Coach app and find workout and nutrition plans, PB challenges and weekly live workouts with the fitness star himself.

I managed a team of developers when the Body Coach app development was brought in-house from a project started with UsTwo and Novoda. 

During my time, I led a team reconfiguration from an Android and an iOS team into two cross-platform mission-based teams. This included the organisation, communication, and bootstrapping of the teams. 

As Engineering Manager of the Get Moving mission team (install to first 30 days in-app) I led a team of developers to deliver multiple features, including an Easy Start week intended to help beginners; in-app messaging from Joe and the trainers to drive momentum; and a highly successful A/B test on our paywall which saw our Intent to Subscribe metric increase significantly.
